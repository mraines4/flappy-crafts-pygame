# flappy-crafts-pygame

This is a  "Flappy Birds" -esque remake I created during my second week in the DigitalCrafts Immersive Bootcamp.

I built this game using Python 3.7.1 with Anaconda and with Pygame.

To play this game, you hit SPACE to initialize game play. During each of the 5 levels, try to keep the DigitalCraft wrench in the air using the UP key.

In order to complete each level, you must make your way through the tubes without touching them.

This python exercise implemented the lessons we learned using OOP and Classes combined with our previous lessons on lists, functions, loops, and more.
