# flappy-crafts-pygame

This is a  "Flappy Birds" -esque remake I created during my second week in the DigitalCrafts Immersive Bootcamp.

I built this game using Python 3.7.1 with Anaconda and with Pygame.

To play this game, you hit SPACE to initialize game play. During each of the 5 levels, try to keep the DigitalCraft wrench in the air using the UP key.

In order to complete each level, you must make your way through the tubes without touching them.
